  instruction: Pick up the dark-red cube and the dark-green cube from the floor and put both in the top compartment of the brown cupboard, which has three compartments one above another. The task succeeds the moment both cubes rest on that compartment's floor.
  env_id: kinder/Shelf3D-o2-v0
  robot: 'TidyBot++: holonomic base, Kinova Gen3 7-DoF arm, Robotiq 2F-85 gripper'

  instance: 'seed 0: the scene KinDER builds from it, pinned by its digest'
  success_criteria:
    - 'KinDER''s own goal check (the environment''s `terminated`) fires within the episode:
      at most 1000 control steps (100 s at 10 Hz); no partial credit'
    - 'unlimited: both fresh-process replays of the handed-in trajectory reach it and
      end in the same state'
    - 'limited: the one episode reaches it (no reset in our runs); the service records
      the episode, and it replays to the same state'
  holding_still: does not reach the goal (checked by running an episode of zero actions)
  action_dim: 11
  actions: base pos and yaw (3), arm joints (7), gripper pos (1); each base and joint delta at most 0.1 a step
  state_dim: 61
  limited_mode: base RGB and wrist RGB-D cameras (480×640), base odometry, the arm's joint angles and velocities, the fingers' position. Not where any object or the goal region is, not the goal check before the episode ends
  agent_budget: 3600 s of wall clock per mode

## Why this task is interesting

Two cubes on the floor go into the top of a cupboard's three compartments, resting on its floor. The robot has to find the cupboard and drive up to it, then reach in through the front: a vertical wrist hits the compartment's roof.

## Capability notes

<!-- Justify the labels in state/tasks/kinder.yml. One bullet per label is
     plenty; reviewers read this to sanity-check the tagging. -->

## Oracle demo review

<!-- KinDER publishes no per-task demonstration; the row shows the
     starting scene. Say here if a reference trajectory is ever recorded. -->

_No demo._

## Discussion

Unlimited mode passes once contact checks show the wrist must tilt 45° to enter the top compartment; limited mode's one episode found and carried the green cube but never found the red one before its 1000 steps ran out. (@williamzhangNU)
