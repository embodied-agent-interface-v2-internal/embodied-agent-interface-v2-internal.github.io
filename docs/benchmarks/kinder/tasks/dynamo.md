  instruction: Drive the robot into the translucent green square marked on the floor; three chairs stand in the way and can be pushed. The task succeeds the moment the centre of the robot's base is inside the square. (The red, blue and yellow squares only mark where the chairs started.)
  env_id: kinder/Dynamo3D-o3-v0
  robot: 'TidyBot++: holonomic base, Kinova Gen3 7-DoF arm, Robotiq 2F-85 gripper'

  instance: 'seed 0: the scene KinDER builds from it, pinned by its digest'
  success_criteria:
    - 'KinDER''s own goal check (the environment''s `terminated`) fires within the episode:
      at most 1000 control steps (100 s at 10 Hz); no partial credit'
    - 'unlimited: both fresh-process replays of the handed-in trajectory reach it and
      end in the same state'
    - 'limited: the one episode reaches it (no reset in our runs); the service records
      the episode, and it replays to the same state'
  holding_still: does not reach the goal (checked by running an episode of zero actions)
  action_dim: 11
  actions: base pos and yaw (3), arm joints (7), gripper pos (1); each base and joint delta at most 0.1 a step
  state_dim: 70
  limited_mode: base RGB and wrist RGB-D cameras (480×640), base odometry, the arm's joint angles and velocities, the fingers' position. Not where any object or the goal region is, not the goal check before the episode ends
  agent_budget: 3600 s of wall clock per mode

## Why this task is interesting

A fixture: drive the base into a square marked on the floor past three chairs, which can be pushed. Without a camera in the room, the base camera sees only the floor in front of it, so the square has to be found first. It checks the whole pipeline end to end and is not scored.

## Capability notes

<!-- Justify the labels in state/tasks/kinder.yml. One bullet per label is
     plenty; reviewers read this to sanity-check the tagging. -->

## Oracle demo review

<!-- KinDER publishes no per-task demonstration; the row shows the
     starting scene. Say here if a reference trajectory is ever recorded. -->

_No demo._

## Discussion

Unlimited mode reads the square's coordinates and drives around the chairs in 135 steps; in limited mode the square never came into view, and the robot swept the room blind until its 1000 steps ran out at 6 minutes. (@williamzhangNU)
