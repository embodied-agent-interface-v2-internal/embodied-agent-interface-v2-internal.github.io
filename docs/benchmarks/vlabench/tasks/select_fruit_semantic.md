  robot: 'Franka Panda: 9 absolute actuator targets (7 arm joints in radians, 2 finger slides in metres)'
  control: 10 Hz (each control held 0.1 s, 100 physics substeps); at most 4000 controls
  observation: 'privileged state: object and robot poses, official skills, IK and planning'
  success_criteria:
    - the native VLABench success condition of select_fruit_semantic, when the trajectory
      ends (controls after native termination are rejected)
    - both fresh-process replays of the trajectory meet it and end in the same exact state
  frozen_instance: our task directory vlabench-select-fruit-semantic-i00 (initial state sha256 83214de0cbcb)
  reference_solution: 'validated: our reference solution meets the native condition in two fresh-process replays'
  agent_budget: 3600 s of wall clock per mode

## Oracle demo review

<!-- Where there is a demo, it is the validated reference solution's controls for this frozen
     instance, replayed by our trusted renderer (camera 2, 10 fps = real time). Say whether
     the trajectory is clean and what it relies on. -->
