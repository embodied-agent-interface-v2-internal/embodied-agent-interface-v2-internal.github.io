  instruction: Retrieve the chicken drumstick, shrimp, and steak from the fridge and place them on the serving tray on the dining counter.
  family: robocasa365/DisplayMeatVariety
  robot: Franka Panda on an Omron mobile base with a torso lift (PandaOmron)
  scene_model: robocasa365_kitchen
  category: Composite · filling serving dishes
  instance: the initial state of official demonstration episode 0 (demo_0); MuJoCo state, model arrays, task state and RNG frozen in instance.npz (SHA-256 da1a79222d83…, checked on load)
  success_criteria:
    - The check for DisplayMeatVariety requires that the drumstick, the shrimp and the
      steak are all on the serving tray, the tray touches the dining counter, and the
      gripper ends more than 0.25 m from all three.
    - 'unlimited (privileged): both fresh-process replays of the handed-in trajectory
      end in the same state, and the check holds on it'
    - 'limited (standard): the one episode (no reset) is recorded by the service and replays
      to the same state; the check holds on it live and in the replay'
  deliverable: (T, 13) native controller commands, 1 ≤ T ≤ 3000, 20 Hz
  reference_solution: 'Retargeted by PR #4 from official demonstration episode 0 (demo_0, 1623 recorded actions; RoboCasa365''s demonstrations use a different arm controller): it follows the demonstration''s recorded arm joint positions as this controller''s absolute joint targets, with the base and torso commands corrected by feedback (PR #4 method demo_feedback). Executed from the frozen scene by the robot''s own controller: 1623 actions in solution/oracle.npz. Neither the demonstration nor the reference is in the image; the agent cannot reach them.'
  limited_mode: 'Standard mode (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.1) of robocasa365-display-meat-variety-i00-privileged: the same frozen instance and success check, served by the sim sidecar (images/robocasa365/standard/server_casa.py, tool module casa_tool), which records the episode, replays it in a fresh simulator and judges it; the verifier grades the sidecar''s record in a container of its own. The agent sees the robot''s cameras (RGB-D, calibrated), its own joints and end effector, and the instruction.'
  oracle: full
  base_image: ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-robocasa365:0.1.0

## Oracle demo review

<!-- The demo is the verifier's replay of our reference solution on this
     task's frozen instance (privileged mode). Say here if it looks wrong. -->
