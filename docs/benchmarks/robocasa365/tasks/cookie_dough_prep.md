  source: https://github.com/robocasa/robocasa @ 4f8a298 (robocasa 1.0.1), as defined in our task definitions @ 8c5594a43
  synced: '2026-10-02'
  instruction: Pick the egg and butter from the fridge and place them by the bowl for mixing.
  family: robocasa365/CookieDoughPrep
  robot: Franka Panda on an Omron mobile base with a torso lift (PandaOmron)
  scene_model: robocasa365_kitchen
  category: Composite · baking
  instance: the initial state of official demonstration episode 0 (demo_0); MuJoCo state, model arrays, task state and RNG frozen in instance.npz (SHA-256 d42caf96db73…, checked on load)
  success_criteria:
    - The check for CookieDoughPrep requires that the egg and the butter each touch a
      counter with their centres within the bowl's horizontal radius + 0.25 m (horizontally)
      of the bowl's, and the gripper ends more than 0.15 m from both.
    - 'unlimited (privileged): both fresh-process replays of the handed-in trajectory
      end in the same state, and the check holds on it'
    - 'limited (standard): the one episode (no reset) is recorded by the service and replays
      to the same state; the check holds on it live and in the replay'
  deliverable: (T, 13) native controller commands, 1 ≤ T ≤ 3000, 20 Hz
  reference_solution: 'Retargeted by PR #4 from official demonstration episode 0 (demo_0, 1795 recorded actions; RoboCasa365''s demonstrations use a different arm controller): it follows the demonstration''s recorded arm joint positions as this controller''s absolute joint targets, with the base and torso commands corrected by feedback (PR #4 method demo_feedback). Executed from the frozen scene by the robot''s own controller: 1795 actions in solution/oracle.npz. Neither the demonstration nor the reference is in the image; the agent cannot reach them.'
  limited_mode: 'Standard mode (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.1) of robocasa365-cookie-dough-prep-i00-privileged: the same frozen instance and success check, served by the sim sidecar (images/robocasa365/standard/server_casa.py, tool module casa_tool), which records the episode, replays it in a fresh simulator and judges it; the verifier grades the sidecar''s record in a container of its own. The agent sees the robot''s cameras (RGB-D, calibrated), its own joints and end effector, and the instruction.'
  oracle: full
  base_image: ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-robocasa365:0.1.0

## Oracle demo review

<!-- The demo is the verifier's replay of our reference solution on this
     task's frozen instance (privileged mode). Say here if it looks wrong. -->
