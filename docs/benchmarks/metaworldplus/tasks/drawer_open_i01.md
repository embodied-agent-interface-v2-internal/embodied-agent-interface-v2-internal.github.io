  robot: Sawyer, fixed wrist, two-finger gripper; mocap XYZ control
  action: '[dx, dy, dz, grip] in [-1, 1]: 0.01 m per unit, grip +1 closes; 80 Hz (5 physics steps of 2.5 ms)'
  horizon: 500 controls (6.25 s simulated)
  success_criteria:
    - the native v3 / reward-v2 success flag, attained at any control of the trajectory
    - both fresh-process replays of the trajectory meet this and end in the same exact
      state

  limited_mode: 'evaluated: RGB-D, calibration and proprioception, one sealed episode'

## Oracle demo review

<!-- The demo is the upstream scripted policy's controls for this frozen instance, replayed
     by our trusted renderer (corner and corner3 cameras, 80 fps = real time). Say whether
     the trajectory is clean and what it relies on. -->
